# Neural Control System for Continuous Glucose Monitoring and Maintenance

The `main.py` has the full code for the simulation. Running this with all deendencies installed will train the model and run a synthetic simulation.

Synthetic test data and model is provided in `data` folder. By replacing them properly, the charts can be reproduced.

Also, a notebook is provided, too.

*We are very sorry for the unorganized code. Due to time constrains, we couldn't manage to organize fully.*
